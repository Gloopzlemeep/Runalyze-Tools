Just some snippits that may be useful :)

the nginx config is what is currently working in my environment 



node_red_flow.json is a Node Red flow to give an example of how to auto import workouts into Runalyze.  My setup is using [HealthFit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/healthfit/id1202650514) to send workouts to a folder in dropbox which is being watched by [node-red-node-dropbox](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-dropbox)
